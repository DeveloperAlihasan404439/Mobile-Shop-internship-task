## Web site name : Mobile Shop [Live Link](https://build-with-innovation-private-limited-task.surge.sh) [Github Link](https://github.com/DeveloperAlihasan404439/Mobile-Shop-internship-task)

I would like to explain everything in the assignment task given by you.

Basically this is a Product searching related website. where are different routes. Home, Crat, Log In, Sign Up, and Log Out. If an user is logged in then he/she will able to see the products. That means these are private routes. There are also a banner gallery count up and acordion section.

This website is mainly authentication based system. That means an user must be registered before log in to the website. If an user is logged in then he/she will see the his/her cart prodcts.

When some one click on the home then he/she will enter in to the home page. where there is a serch option by which he/she will able to serch desired product by price, name.

After clicking add crat button the product will be added to the crad list and redirect the crad page will be displayed.

Only logged in user can get access to the all products page because i heve implemented a user athentication system.
